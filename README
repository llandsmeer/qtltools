This is a fork of the QTLtools v1.2 release, with the following changes:

 - applied --std-err and r2 patch (daaa9fd) which adds a
`  standard error of the slope column

 - ignore leading zeros in chromosome comparisons between
   genotype and phenotype for cis pass - which might slow
   down code a little bit
